<p> <i>In today's world , man has become monotonous. Either working till wee hours or being pressurized to cut through the competitive world , he has been become nothing but greedy. His inner child is dead and soul too trying hard to live upto full extent. The only way to de-stress one-self is through doing what you love. 
For me, it was and it is "Travelling"... </i></p> <br>

Travelling means going from one's place to another or from one's country to another. This instinct of roaming about is rooted in man's nature. This instinct leads a man to see the unseen, to know the unknown and to unveil the mystery. <br>

<li> <p> Even if you hear or read something about a certain culture, it’s important to realise that doesn’t mean everyone from that particular background acts/thinks/believes the same thing. Just as not everyone you know has identical beliefs; people who come from different cultural backgrounds aren’t all a certain way either.

One of the biggest difficulties to overcome in understanding cultural differences is making judgements based on one opinion. Do your own research and make an effort to actually learn about people instead of making broad brush statements.

The main thing to remember is that everyone, no matter what their cultural background, has different opinions, habits and ways of life. The quicker we accept that everyone is different, the easier it becomes to understand and embrace&nbsp;cultural&nbsp; differences.

I have been asked so many times “why do you travel alone?”  Well, simple, I love traveling alone.  Don’t get me wrong, I do love traveling with friends too but for some reason I prefer going solo.  I consider traveling solo a good learning experience and an introspective journey. There are no competing desires that have to be taken into account in order to have a “good” traveling experience.  The freedom is great and the “one-on-one” time with yourself is priceless.
